# Tip Calculator

An iOS demo app for calculating tip amount, with percentages, on bill amount and shows total amount to pay.

**Time spent:** Six hours.

**Tasks:**
- User should be able to input bill amount and select tip percentage (10%, 15%, 20%) for the total bill to pay.
- User should be able to set default tip percentage in settings view.

**Notes:**
Spent time in understanding & played with general settings for the app. 

**Learnings:**
While development learned that properties associated for UI elements, which are created with xib will create new & have references for old when an existing property is updated which throwed an exception  

**Walkthrough of user stories:**
